Another solution is to keep dividing the number by two, i.e, do n = n/2 iteratively. 
In any iteration, if n%2 becomes non-zero and n is not 1 then n is not a power of 2.
 If n becomes 1 then it is a power of 2.


bool isPowerOfTwo(int n)
{
  if (n == 0)
    return 0;
  while (n != 1)
  {
      if (n%2 != 0)
         return 0;
      n = n/2;
  }
  return 1;
}
