As per the standard QUICK SORT is the best sorting algorithm among all the comparison based sorting algorithm but it will give the worst case only when all the elements of an array is already sorted which is rarely happening.

Which sorting algorithm is best and when:

1.INSERTION SORT: when arrays most of the elements are sorted

2. QUICK SORT: a).when arrays most of the elements are random

b).small size array

3.MERGESORT: a).when arrays no behavior is given

b).big size array

4.COUNT SORT: when in the set of n elements each element range is given

5.RADIX SORT: when in the set of n elements every element contain the number of digits is given

6.SELECTION SORT: when we required lesser swaps
